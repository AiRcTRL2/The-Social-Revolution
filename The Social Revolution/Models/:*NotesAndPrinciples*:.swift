 This file is to record notes of what type of classes we will need as I'm doing reserach.
 
 - CBT Principles:
    1. Continuous evolvement of patients' problems
        - identify current thinking
        - identify current problematic behaviours
        - precipitating/triggering factors for the development of their issue
        - key development events/ specific events that reinforced their disorder
        - enduring patterns of interpreting events (i.e. filtering achievements through discounting lens e.g. "luck", while firmly attributing weaknesses as their "true" self.
    2. CBT requires a positive, trusting theraputic alliance
        - Tough to achieve in the app world, but comfort may be simulated to a certain extent through the use of consistent character and a pleasant, charming UI.
        - This point, in the digital world, will strongly influence UI decisions.
        - When responding to user input, an encouraging, warm, empathetic, caring attitude should be used which conveys genuine concern for the user's self improvement.
        - Emphasize small and large successes while maintaining realistic and optimistic outlooks
        - Find better ways to improve elicit feedback regarding how the platform treats the user, attempt to alter how the software works based on preselected options of feedback
    3. CBT requires active participation
        - Work collaboratively with user to set goals, challenges & homework
        - Allow user to select the discussion topics
        - Encourage user to identify distortions in thinking
        - Encourage user to summarise the discussions
    4. CBT is goal oriented and problem focused
        - Enumerate problems with user
        - Work collaboratively to set goals (remind user what they are working towards)
        - Validate thoughts via examintation for/against automatic thoughts
        - Correcting distortions in thinking leads to straightforward problem solving to decrease isolation
    5. CBT initially emphasises the present
        - This means that we focus on current problems and SPECIFIC situations that are distressing to the user
        - Need to encourage the user to respond to automatic thoughts in real time in order to take steps to improve their life
        - If the user expresses strong interest in tacking/processing historical issues, this should be permitted.
        - This can be beneficial occaisionally when the user is stuck in the childhood roots of their beliefs, and modifying these beliefs are key to the success of the therapy
    6. CBT is educative and aims to teach the patient the skills to be their own therapist with an emphasis on relapse prevention
        - Educate the user on the nature and course of the disorder
        - Cognitive model => Beliefs/Assumptions influence thoughts -> thoughts influence emotions -> emotions influence behaviour
        - Teach the skills to identify & evaluate thoughts and beliefs and to plan behavioural changes which result in improvement
    7. CBT is time limited -> results in X amount of time
    8. CBT sessions follow a structure
        1. Mood Check
        2. Reviewing the week (how things have gone generally, setting and agenda for the session -- i.e. selecting discussion topics / prioritising problems)
        3. Middle: changes in feelings (positive + negative), automatic thoughts that occurred, behaviours (positive + negative + results on emotions), setting new homework, summarising the session
        4. Final: Feedback, session adjustment, determining patient satisfaction
    9. CBT teaches patients to identify, evaluate and respond to their dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs by adopting more realistic, adaptive perspectives.
        - This helps patients feel better emotionally
        - It's done through guided discovery, using questioning to help patients evaluate their thinking
        - Create behavioral experiments (called experiences) for patients to directly test their thinking
        - Wrong to imply you know to what extent a patient's automatic thought is valid or invalid, but is right to collaborately work towards testing their assumptions
        - If together the body of evidence outweighs the evidence for the fact that the automatic thought was valid, then the patients new viewpoints should be recorded for review throughout the week (send reminders daily / at an agreed time?)
        - Do not challenge the validity of an automatic thought, encourage the uncritical adoption of more positive view points, nor try to convince them that their thinking was unrealistically pessimistic. These need to be realised by the patient. Use the patient's own words from responses to the questions.
    10. CBT uses a variety of techniques to change thinking, mood and behaviour.
        - Behavioural and problem-solving techniques are essential
        - Gestalt techniques / Psychodynamically inspired techniques --> Requires research

    General tips:
        - Frame things as experiments, giving the user the ability to feedback whether they feel if something works or not + adapt based on response
        - The entry point for CBT is noticing changes in mood / negative thinking and recording thoughts that occurred at those times. These can be assessed in real time when skilled, or at a later point when unskilled.
        - Frequently reinforce the cognitive model, help evaulate and respond to aautomatic thoughts and ask for summaries
        - Record the cognitive model with the patients own examples -> Personalised understanding
        - Overcoming disorders requires being active. That means, if people have withdrawn from activities that provide the opportunity for mastery or pleasure, these must be resumed again. Exposure to them will help patients feel much better.
    
    General treatment objectives:
        - Develop relationship (good counseling skills, accurate understanding, sharing the plan, collaborate decision making, get feedback, change style, help patients solve problems and alleviate distress)
        - Plan treatment & structure sessions
        - Identify and response to dysfunctional cognitions
        - Emphasise positive behaviours/results/thoughts
        - Facilitate behavioural changes between sessions (homework/assignments)
        - Always note positive data which can be used later/in future sessions when helping to evaluate relevant automatic thoughts or beliefs.
 
    ** Developing the relationship **:
        - Empathic statements, word choice, tone, expression & body language
        - Accurately understanding the patients problems. Use their own words and ask whether you've understood something correctly. Results in positive rapport via feeling values & understood.
        - Patient will feel more likeable (friendly attitude towards them), less alone (collaborating to solve problems), optimistic (through realistic hope about treatment), greater sense of self-efficacy (show where they deserve credit for solving problems, doing homework, engaging in productive activities)
 
    ** Cognitive conceptualisation **:
        - This is the framework for understanding the patient & their problems.
        - What is their diagnoses?
        - What are their **CURRENT** problems (currently causing their emotional mood/negativity)? How did they develop (Precipitations/Triggers/History)? How are they being maintained (Automatic thoughts, core beliefs, behaviours that reinforce core beliefs)?
        - What are the underlying core beliefs (atitudes, expectations and rules) and thoughts?
        - How does the patient currently cope with dysfunctional cognitions (are they reinforced by unproductive behaviours)?
        - What are the stressers that contribute to the development of the current psychological problem or prevent resolution?
        - If relevant, what early experiences lead to this point? What meaning does the patient associate to these experiences and what beliefs originated/strengthened from them?
        - Cognitive, affective (emotional) and behavioural mechanisms used to cope with these beliefs?
        - What were the significant life events, experiences and interactions involved?
        - What are the patient's most basic beliefs about himself, his world, and others?
        - What strategies are used to cope with negative beliefs?
        - What thoughts help to maintain the disorder?
        - Conceptualisation should be confirmed by the patient
 
    ** Sharing your conceptualisation of the patient/issue **:
        - First identify a problem by finding out what happened
        - Second find out what the thoughts were
        - Third find out what emotions were felt
        - Fourth find out what the behavioural response was
        - Fifth feedback your understanding to the user
        - Patients want to know their general diagnosis
        - We should establish that they are not strange or abnormal
        - Normalise the disorder, symptoms and strategies + results of improvement.
 
    ** The cognititve model **:
        - Hypothesis that people's emotions, behaviours and physiology are influenced by their perception of events
        - Situation/event/scenario -> Automatic thought -> Reactions (emotional, behavioural, physiological)
        - It is not the situation itself that causes what people feel, it's how they mentally construe that situation (i.e. their thoughts beforehand or how they interpret or think about the situation -- their perception).
        - This perception is often sub-conscious, meaning that the perception of the situation is filtered through our automatic thoughts and core beliefs that may be dysfunctional, resulting in an inaccurate view of and negative emotional, physiolgical or behaveioral response to this situation.
        - Automatic thoughts are not a result of deliberation or reasoning, they are spontaneous -- informed by our experience and environment.
        - Often, we are more aware of the behaviour or emotion that follows an automatic thought rather than the thought itself. That's why in CBT, we focus on identifying these thoughts so we can more critically evaluate them in real time - and in some cases - proving thought our perception of the event or situation is misconstrued and protecting ourselves from the negative emotions or behaviours that follow.
 
    ** Automatic thoughts **:
        - Automatic thoughts are often sub-conscious filters which situations or events are processed through and thus influence our emotional, physiological or behaviour response to a stimulus. This means that if our core beliefs or assumptions are incorrect, an incorrect -- often negative, perception of an event or situation occurs, making us feel or react negatively.
        - With CBT, we learn to identify and critically evaluate these thoughts in real time, which should reduce our distress relating to certain events or situations.
        - Identifying automatic thoughts:
            1. You begin to feel dysphoric -> What is going through my mind?
            2. You feel inclined to behave in a dysfunctional way -> What is going through my mind and why am I doing this behaviour?
            3. You notice distressing changes in your body or mind -> What is going through my mind?
        - When you find your interpretation of a situation is erroneous and correct it, you may notice your mood improves, you behave in a more functional way and/or your physiological arousal decreases.
        - This process is called objective reflection.
        - Automatic thoughts can chain together -> Thought X -> Behaviour/Feeling X -> Thought Y: "Why am I feeling like X"? -> Behaviour Y -> etc
        - If automatic thoughts are not identified and evaluated, they're often accepted uncritically which leads to our negative behaviours and emotions.
        - Addressing automatic thoughts:
            1. Explain what automatic thoughts are
            2. Identify thoughts, then judge critically whether they're true or not (evidence weighing, scenario thinking, advice giving)
            3. Ask the patient if they have any ideas of how they could improve this situation? Ask for more.
            4. Ask if this is a problem that someone else can help with, or if there's someone you can practice with?
            5. Do automatic thoughts prevent you from thinking of these solutions?
            6. Decide solution collaboratively
            7. Elicit likelihood of doing goal
            8. Assuming success, what do you think about your original prediction X?
            9. Review current emotion: After critcally eval'ing thought, how do you feel now?
            10. Summarise what happened during this process.
            11. Elicit feedback
            12. Explain that learning to evaluate thoughts like this is a skill for you to learn, and to remember that such thoughts may or may not be true.
        - Expect to have ups and downs, it's not all smooth sailing. Learn positive coping mechanisms when things go south. Setbacks are normal.
        - Use patients own words as much as possible to convey accurate understanding
        - After providing your summary, ask the patient to summarise what we just processed. Can you summarise what we just discussed? What do you think the main message is here? What do you think would be important for you to remember?
 
    ** Core beliefs **:
        - From childhood, people develop ideas about themselves, their world and other people.
        - Our central beliefs are called core beliefs.
        - They are beliefs so fundamental and deep that we rarely notice or think about them to ourselves.
        - We regard them as absolute truths, "the way things 'are'"
        - Core beliefs & assumptions filter our experiences and categorise them, which can reinforce our core beliefs -- even negatively.
        - For example, a positive experience that challenges our core belief becomes discounted an attributed to another reason than simply "we were successeful or good" at something. They are not a reflection of true self, or ability.
        - A negative experience, however, reinforces the core belief and IS a reflection of true self --> "I knew I was too stupid to read this book", reinforcing the thought that the person does not have intellectual capability.
        - This viscious cycle leads to a host of inaccurate perceptions of oneself and constantly strengthens their dysnfunctional core belief, which makes it difficult to unravel.
        - This natural process of filtering our thoughts, emotions and behaviours through our beliefs is called belief activation.
        - Belief activation can be positive or negative. Mood can play a role in which beliefs (belief schemas) are activated at any one moment, which in turn effects our emotions and behaviours.
        - Core beliefs are general, where automatic thoughts are words/images that enter a person's mind based on a specific situation -- most superficial level of cognition.
        - Intermediate beliefs exist between the two. Intermediate beliefs are made up of:
            - Attitudes -> "It's terrible to fail" -> This should be a point of reflection
            - Rule -> "Give up if challenge is too great" -> This rule should be challenged
            - Assumption -> "If I try to do x, I'll fail and feel bad. If I avoid it, I avoid feeling bad and I'll be okay." -> This behaviour is clearly dysfunctional
        - So an elongated cognitive model might look something more like (CISAR):
            - Core Belief (Fundamental beliefs about oneself and their world)
                -> Intermediate belief (rules (coping strategy), attitudes (feeling about X situation) & assumptions (attitudes + rules = assumed strategy) which formulate automatic thoughts)
                    -> Automatic thoughts (words or images that flash in a person's might related to a specific situation and influence actions, physiology and emotion)
                        -> Feeling, physiological response or behaviour (resulting from the entire process)
        - Thankfully, dysfucntional beliefs can be unlearned. CBT aims to facilitate the direct moficiation of core beliefs so that patients can better interpret situations in a more realistc and constructive manner.
        - This occurs through focusing on noticing and changing automatic thoughts which are the closest cognition to conscious awareness. Parting from those mentalitites involve understanding that:
            1. Belief doesn't mean true
            2. Thinking needs to be more reality based in order to feel better and progress toward the goal
        - By completing this process with automatic thoughts, patients are more likely to challenges their core beliefs and understandings of the world that underlie their dysfunctional thinking.
        - Deeper modifiction of ones belief system results in patients being less likely to relapse.
        - Example of a core belief: Sibling inferiority -> Comparison belief -> I'll never be as good as X at Y.
        - Coping strategies are based on the fear or the construed thought of the situation occurring. Many times, coping strategies result in an avoidance mechanism. These avoidaance mechanisms can often be considered dysfunctional behaviours as they're often self-defeating.
 
    ** Guided discovery**:
        - What is the evidence that your thought is true?
        - What is the evidence that your thought may not be true?
        - What is an alternative way of viewing this situation? ** therapist inspired **
        - What is the worst that could happen? How would you cope if it did?
            - * Coping cards can be used to remind users of how they could respond in the siutation if the situation occurs, the behaviour occurs or the thought occurs (e.g. avoidance)
        - What's the best that could happen?
        - What's the most realistic outcome of the situation?
        - If you were to give advice to someone else experiencing this issue, what advice would you give?
        - What do you think you should do?
  
    ** Homework // Facilitating behavioural change between sessions **:
        - When it comes to setting goals, much of the time it involves reminding users of new perspectives or concepts they've learned during the theraputic sessions. Did we help them weigh the evidence? What was the outcome? Did we teach a CBT concept?
        - Have patients identify and respond to their dysfunctional thinking throughout the week.
        - In the final part of a session, user's should provide a summary of the session for review throughout the week.
        - Help patients evaluate and respond to automatic thoughts they're likely to experience between sessions
        - Help patients devise solutions to their problems that they're likely to experience during the week
        - Teach patients new skills to practice during the week
        - Homework should involve:
            1. Behavioural changes: e.g. Isolation => maybe calling a friend?, overworked => Discussing workload with supervisor?
            2. a. Identifying automatic thoughts and beliefs when one notices a dysfunctional change in affect, behaviour or physiology
            2. b. Evaluating and responding to these automatic thoughts through Socratic questioning, behavioural experiments, &/ reading session notes/lessons
            3. Reading solutions to problems that were solved during the session but the user is likely to encounter
        - Patients deserve CREDIT for completing these goals, as they are things that are personally very difficult for them.
        - Encourage them to give themselves credit everytime they're not partaking in their maladaptive behaviours.
        - Activities should be ranked 0-10 on a Pleasure/Mastery scale -> Or high med low if not good with numbers
 
    ** Making collaborative decisions **:
        - Elicit approval when deciding anything such as discussion topics, homework
 
    ** Seeking Feedback **:
        - Never ignore negative feedback. Failure to identifiy or addres these reduces patient ability to focus on solving their real-life difficulties and feel better.
        - It is important to positively reinforce patients' positive feedback
 
    ** Getting to know the user **:
        - What are some of your strengths & positive qualities?
        - What positive things happened since we last spoke?
        - What positive things did you do?
 
    ** EVALUATION SESSION STRUCTURE **:
        - Greet the patient
        - Collaboratively set the agenda and convey appropriate expecations -> What you'd like to cover this session, what we want to achieve, we want to set goals, explore the feelings/thoughts
        - Conduct assessment
            -> Demographics, complaints & problems, coping strategies (adaptive + maladaptive), developmental history, family history + status, social status + history (e.g. activity vs before), educational history + current status, vocational history + status, religious history + status, strengths + values + adaptive coping strategies
            -> Describe a typical day (variations in mood, interactions with others, generally functioning, spend free time)
        - Some of the above assessment params may not apply to social axiety specifically
        - Set broad goals (what do we hope to achieve by the end of this session, end of therapy etc)
        - Get feedback (investigate if anything was missed/reluctant to share
 
    ** Standard session structure **:
        -- Start Session --
        - Mood check
        - Set agenda
        - Obtain update
        - Review HW
        - Prioritise agenda
        
        -- Middle session -- (solving patient problem situation, eval auto thoughts + respond, reducing distress, suggesting behavioural changes, decreasing physiological arousal)
        - Work on specific problem & teach CBT skills in that context
        - Follow up with collaboratively set HW assignments
        - Work on a second problem
 
        -- End session -- (Summarise realisations & lessons, review and agree goals, ask for summary, find out if the session was positive or negative)
        - Provide/elicit a summary
        - Review new HW
        - Elicit feedback
 
    ** Behavioral activation **:
        - One of the biggest treatment objective is setting active goals & scheduling activities
        - Withdrawing from activities is a maladaptive behaviour adopted my patients in order to avoid the negative feeling associated with their attitude of how an event or situation will make them feel. It is a form of avoidance. By doing so, they also reduce their exposure to moments of when they can feel mastery (sense of achievement) or pleasure (moments they previously enjoyed). It means that the only experiences the person may be having are the negative ones, or ones that provide symptom relief but do not resolve the disorder itself... and so are stuck in a spiral of symptom relief but no problem resolution. This can lead to a belief that they will never improve.
        - Helping to become more active adn give themselves credit for their efforts is an essential part of treatment and to strengthening their sense of self efficacy by demonstrating they have control over their mood.
        - Note: Sometimes engaging in activities may not result in boosts in mood, due to self-critical thoughts based on core belief processing. If this happens, core beliefs need to be worked on in addition to scheduling activities.
        - We can do this by pre-emptively anticipating automatic thoughts that could interfere with the enjoyment or sense of achievement of the activity.
        - Process:
            1. Identify activities the patient is doing too little of
            2. Measure if a good balance of mastery & pleasure experiences exist
            3. What activities are lowest in mastery or pleasure (and thus are inherently dysphoric/maladaptive) and should be reduced?
        - Positively question a negative maladaptive behaviour to test the patient's response
            - Does behaviour X make you feel better?
 
    -- Feedback elicitation questions --
        - I want to make sure that I understand
        - Did I get that right?
        - Is it okay if we talk about that?
        - Does that seem okay?
        - How does that sound?
        - Does anything I said here not sound good?
        - Are you willing to give it a try?
        - Is that clear?
        - Is it okay if I set a reminder for ... X @ Y?
        - Can you see how changing your thinking and doing some problem solving might help improve your mood?
        - How likely are yoou to ... x. Could you do this today?
        - Could you tell me why it imght be worth doing this?
 
    -- Coping questions --:
        - Do you think it will be important to remember that if ... doesn't necessarily mean ...
 
    -- Identifying positive experience questions --:
        - What positive things happened this week?
        - When were some times that you felt even a little better this week?
 
    -- Reflection questions --:
        - How do you feel now that ... X
 
    -- Explanation statements --:
        - What we are attempting to do together is...
        - ... help you see things more realistically
        - Can we discuss for a moment how X...

    -- Positive outlook statements --:
        - I want to understand what you're experiencing and help you
        - I am confident we can work well together and that behavioural therapy will work
        - I've helped other patients like you
        - That's how we find people get better, by making small changes in their thinking and behaviour every day.
    
    -- Positive reinforcement statements --
        - I think it's great that you...
        - That's valuable information
        - What does that say about you that you... x?
        - What a great idea to...
        - It's good that you told me that...
        - What makes you think ... X ... What do you think would help more?
        - Not your fault that you have negative thinking...
    
    -- Informative or thought provoking statemnets/questions --
        - Do you see how that idea might ... x
        - Do you see how that idea can make you feel ... x
        - Do you see how that idea might make you want to ... x
        - Can you see how that thought might stop you from ... x
        - What's the evidence that ... x
        - What's the evidence that ... not x
        - Is there another way of look at ... X ... where it doesn't mean X?
        - Is it clear to you that how you... influence how you ...
        - Does that give you an idea of what you might like to change? -> Response = goal
        - How could we test this idea to see if it's true? -> Response = goal
        - Would there be an advantage to doing that?
        - If it turns out well... could you keep doing x?
        - Isn't that interesting? Your reaction was that... but when we compare it to... we demonstrated that it was... Your automatic thoughts are probably interefering with your ability to derive pleasure/mastery from X
        
    -- Perspective changing questions -> Compare situation to another, then ask if they'd still feel the same --:
        - If you had/did ... X ...  would you still -call- yourself ... x?
        - Would it help if you answered back the thought... ""?
        - What could you remind yourself when ... x
    
    -- Goal investigating questions --:
        - What other gaols do you have?
        - How would you like to be different?
        - How would you like your life to be different as a result of X?
        - (if goal was broad) -> And if you were X, what would you be doing?
        - Goals should be personal and not relate to another person. If they relate to someone else, it has to involve something that the patient can control or change about how they do X.
        - What do you think is most important to remember this week?
        - How do you feel about the idea that getting more active might help improve your mood?
        - Should we make this goal optional (if difficulty expected)?
        - Behavioral experiment goals provide the opportunity for the patient to test their conclusions
        - Anything else you need to change?
        - If prediction was inaccurate and goal was successful at changing mood/perception, should we more of that?
 
    -- Investigating pleasure/mastery scores --:
        - You mentioned that doing X was only X on the scale. Do you know why? What was going through your mind? -> Then standard process for assessing thoughts/emotions.
    
    -- Mood checking questions --:
        - Can you think of any time recently when you noticed your mood change? When you were aware that you had become upset? Can you tell me more about it?
        - Do you remember what you were thinking?
        - Do you know how those thoughts made you feel? Disappointed, afraid, sad, worried, angry?
        - (stimulating memory) Can you imagine yourself back in... describe the scene... how are you feeling... what's going through your mind?
 
    -- Summarising questions --:
        - Can you tell me in your own words about the connections between thoughts and feelings?
 
    -- Potential limiting scenarios of treatment --:
        - The comparison trap: When a patient compares themselves at their worst to when they were at their best. It is more effective to encourage comparison of their current self (after doing an activity) to their worst self (i.e. before doing the activity). This results in being less critical and also seeing tangible goals that are more immediate than distant.
 
    -- Potential core beliefs --:
        - Incompetence
        - Inadequacy
        - Inferiority
 
    -- Potential negative behaviours --:
        - Isolation
        - Reduced eye contact
        - Unwillingness to speak
        - Avoidance
        - Physical coping mechanisms
